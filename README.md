# Marketing-Analysis-Project

## Project Background 
Accel, established in 2020, is an independent "tech-focused" marketing firm offering services such as omnichannel execution, content marketing, digital experience, and branding.

As Q4 concludes, Accel is reviewing its four largest clients to identify successes and gaps across all 2025 marketing campaigns, aiming to inform future client engagements and refine upcoming campaign strategies.

Insights and recommendations are provided in these key areas:

**Campaign Performance Analysis**: Compare conversion rate, acquisition cost, ROI, engagement score, clicks, and impressions across different campaign types, channels, locations, languages, and customer segments.

**Customer Segmentation Analysis**: Analyze results by target audience and customer segment to discover which groups respond best to different campaign types or channel mixes.

**Engagement and Funnel Analysis**: Relate engagement_score to conversion and downstream metrics to see how user interaction correlates with business outcomes.

**Seasonality Analysis**: Identify and interpret recurring patterns in business outcomes that are linked to specific periods or cycles.

## Data Structure Overview

The data for this analysis is organized in a relational cloud database that is hosted by Accel. Details of a marketing campaign are divided into various tables in a star schema, all linked using a primary key. The tables are Campaign Customer, Campaign_ Details, Campaign Location, and Campaign Outcomes. See Table 1 for the fields in the different data tables.
